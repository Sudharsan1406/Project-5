# Project-5

##  Problem Statement 
######  This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for classifying brain MRI 
###### images into multiple categories according to tumor type. It involves building a custom 
###### CNN model from scratch and enhancing performance through transfer learning using 
###### pretrained models. The project also includes deploying a user-friendly Streamlit web 
###### application to enable real-time tumor type predictions from uploaded MRI images.


## Real-Time Business Use Cases 
#### 1. AI-Assisted Medical Diagnosis: 
##### Provide radiologists with AI-powered tools to quickly classify brain tumors based 
##### on MRI images, reducing diagnostic turnaround time and increasing accuracy. 
#### 2. Early Detection and Patient Triage: 
##### Automatically flag high-risk MRI images for immediate specialist review, 
##### improving hospital workflow and patient care prioritization. 
#### 3. Research and Clinical Trials: 
##### Use AI classification tools to segment patient datasets by tumor type, aiding in 
##### research studies and clinical trial recruitment. 
#### 4. Second-Opinion AI Systems: 
##### Deploy AI-powered classification tools in telemedicine or remote consultation 
##### setups for second-opinion diagnostics in under-resourced healthcare regions.
